            Remember those old days where this website was pretty much
            stockpile HTML, with about 5 css tags? Did you know that I wasn't
            even the one who wrote that? Well it's true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, I don't like remembering those times, and so I decided to
            completely reset all of the versions of this webiste, and go back to
            good old version 1.0. Well that was last version. Version 1.X ended
            on version 1.5, and now we are moving on to version 2.0. Thats this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to move on to this version from not only not wanting to
            accept the previous versions as part of this website's history, but
            also the fact that I just don't like high numbers, and moving on to
            version 6.0 from version 5.5 makes it seem that much less important.
            So we are back at version two, and I promise you that there won't be
            any more resets.
