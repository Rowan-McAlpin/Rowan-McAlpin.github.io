        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>Hey, all!</p>
        <p>My name is Rowan McAlpin, and I am a genius. Or, at least, <em>I</em> think so. Well, anyway, I am a computer programmer. And I am 12. You heard me right. I created this site <strong><em>from scratch</em></strong>. Meaning bare code.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article column1">
        <h3>How this site was made</h3>
        <p>I made this site with very clear intentions in mind: an outstandingly easy-to-use layout, with a dark theme (look for the link at the bottom), that appeared to be made with a site-making webkit, like wix*.</p>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>The steps I used to make this website were quite simple:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Design layout</li>
          <li>Decide content</li>
          <li>Make sitemap</li>
          <li>Code home file</li>
          <li>Create CSS files</li>
          <li>Add in all other HTML files.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Thats it!</em></p>
        <p>Please note: I have not relationship whatsoever with wix. I used it as an example.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Coding career</h3>
        <p>I started coding when I was 8. My dad was showing me a website <em>he</em> had coded, and I knew then and there that I wanted to learn to code. Believe it or not, my best language is <em>not</em> HTML, though that is up there. I like Python most of all. Anyway, my dad wrote out a list of all of the basic commands, like &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, etc.</p>
        <p>Once I learned those by heart, I went looking for more. Soon after, I learned my uncle also codes, so I reached out to him. He taught me some more, and let me use a sub-domain, the one I am still using today, rowan.cementhorizon.com.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Other than coding, some of my hobbies are</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Playing guitar</li>
          <li>D&D (Of course)</li>

            <h2>What in the world</h2>
            <h3>Is Egnition Labratories?</h3>
            <h5>Written by Rowan on June 24, 2020.</h5>

          <p>
            As you have probably already deduced, Egnition Labratories is an
            enterprise run by a single person, me, Rowan. We have about one
            employee.
          </p>
          <h5>Then what are we?</h5>
          <p>
            Well, we are an orginisation that wants to (what else) make money.
            But we haven't made a single cent. And thats okay. We take pleasure
            in programming. In fact, if you didn't already know, we are working
            on developing a text-based video game. No, I am not going to leak
            any  details.
          </p>
          <p>We want to have fun doing what we do, and so we do. That's it!</p>
