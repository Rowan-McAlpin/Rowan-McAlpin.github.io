# EGNITION LABS WEBSITE
I have phased out ALL previous styles, content, and versions, and am resetting the version count.

Once again, I have updated the site. I am now using some tags like
```html
<header>
<section>
<article>
<nav>
```

There is information about this at [my website.](https://rowan.cementhorizon.com)

Create an issue to let me know what I should change, and I'll look into it when I get the chance.
