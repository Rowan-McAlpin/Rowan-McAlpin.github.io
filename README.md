# EGNITION LABS WEBSITE
I have phased out ALL previous styles, content, and versions, and am resetting the version count.

Once again, I have updated the site. I am now using some tags like
```html
<header>
<section>
<article>
<nav>
```

There is information about this at [my website.](https://rowan.cementhorizon.com)

Also, I have renamed my enterprise from Platinum Programming (I didnt like this name, because its more than a programming company) to Egnition Labratories (Egnition or Egnition Labs for short.)
