# Rowan McAlpin Website
Once again, I have made a drastic change.

My CSS now is mobile-friendly, meaning it will rearrange itself when on a smaller device.

There is information about this at [my website.](https://rowan.cementhorizon.com)

If you have a problem with the code, please start an issue, and I will be sure to check it out.
