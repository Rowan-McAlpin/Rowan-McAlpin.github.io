I have phased out ALL previous styles, content, and versions. I am resetting my version count, because I hated the other versions and I refuse to accept them as part of my websites history. There is information about this at rowan.cementhorizon.com.
If you would like to give recommendations about stuff to add, remove, or change, just throw me a PR or open an issue.
