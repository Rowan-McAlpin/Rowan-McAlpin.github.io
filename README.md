# EGNITION LABS WEBSITE
I have phased out ALL previous styles, content, and versions, and am resetting the version count. 
As the director of Egnition Labs said,
  > I hated the other versions and I refuse to accept them as part of my websites history. 

There is information about this at [my website.](https://rowan.cementhorizon.com)

Also, I have renamed my enterprise from Platinum Programming (I didnt like this name, because its more than a programming company) to Egnition Labratories (Egnition or Egnition Labs for short.)

```python
def funct():
    print("Hello")
funct()
```
