#EGNITION LABS WEBSITE
I have phased out ALL previous styles, content, and versions. I am resetting my version count, because I hated the other versions and I refuse to accept them as part of my websites history. There is information about this at rowan.cementhorizon.com.

Also, I have renamed my enterprise from Platinum Programming (I didnt like this name, because its more than a programming company) to Egnition Labratories (Egnition or Egnition Labs for short.)
