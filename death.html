            <h3>Egnition Labs is history!</h3>
            <p>Y' know how a while back, this site had a ton of stuff about a very conspicuous "Platinum Programming"?
                And then one day, not too long ago, it changed? Suddenly everything was branded as "Egnition Labs"?
                The layout changed, the content changed, the background changed. And then one day, quite recently, I
                changed it again.
                It became a sort-of-decent website layout, except for a few prominent bugs? Well, it's changed again, as
                you can see.
            </p>
            <p>I've dropped all pseudo-company branding, completely renovated my layout and content, and settled for a
                simple yet complete,
                no-nonsence site. Now, you could call it a blog of sorts. <br><strong>Please note:</strong> This site is
                still in progress. <br>We will continue the development, and it will grow.</p>
