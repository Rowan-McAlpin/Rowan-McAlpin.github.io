        <h3>What is <em>Egnition Labs</em>?</h3>
        <p>Egnition Labs is a pseudo-company created and staffed by me, Rowan McAlpin. I do the programming and distribution.</p>

        <h3>Version count RESET</h3>
        <p>With this complete renovation of this site, I have made the executive decision to reset my version count. From hereonafter, this version (version 4) will be titled version one.</p>
        <p>The previous versions are <strong><em>history</em></strong>.</p>      </div>
      <div class="article column2">
        <h3>Fourth Edition Open!</h3>
        <p>Remember those old days a couple of years back, where this very website was a graveyard of junky coding? Well, I have progressed above and beyond! This is the fourth version of my website, and it is <strong>way</strong> better than that first edition.</p>
        <p>The second edition was where I introduced that iconic blue circled gradient background. The third update was when <emp>D&D Zone</emp> was introduced, along with some more ease of navigation.</p>
        <p>And now, this fourth version! I have completely scrapped the CSS files, and have moved on to a much-more user-friendly <strong>fluid layout</strong>. I hope you enjoy this new site!</p>
